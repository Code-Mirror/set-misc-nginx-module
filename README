Description
    This module allows you to add, set, or clear any output or input header
    that you specify.

    This is an enhanced version of the standard headers module because it
    provides more utilities like resetting or clearing "builtin headers"
    like "Content-Type", "Content-Length", and "Server".

    It also allows you to specify an optional HTTP status code criteria
    using the "-s" option and an optional content type criteria using the
    "-t" option while modifying the output headers with the more_set_headers
    and more_clear_headers directives. For example,

        more_set_headers -s 404 -t 'text/html' 'X-Foo: Bar';

    Input headers can be modified as well. For example

        location /foo {
            more_set_input_headers 'Host: foo' 'User-Agent: faked';
            # now $host, $http_host, $user_agent, and
            #   $http_user_agent all have their new values.
        }

    The option "-t" is also available in the more_set_input_headers and
    more_clear_input_headers directives while the "-s" option is not
    allowed.

    Unlike the standard headers module, this module's directives will by
    default apply to all the status codes, including "4xx" and "5xx".

Directives
  more_set_headers
    syntax: *more_set_headers [-t <content-type list>]... [-s <status-code
    list>]... <new-header>...*

    default: *no*

    context: *http, server, location, if*

    Adds or replaces the specified output headers when the response status
    code matches the codes specified by the "-s" option *AND* the response
    content type matches the types specified by the "-t" option.

    If either "-s" or "-t" is not specified or has an empty list value, then
    no match is required. Therefore, the following directive set the
    "Server" output header to the custom value for *any* status code and
    *any* content type:

      more_set_headers    "Server: my_server";

    A single directive can set/add multiple output headers. For example

      more_set_headers 'Foo: bar' 'Baz: bah';

    Multiple occurrences of the options are allowed in a single directive.
    Their values will be merged together. For instance

      more_set_headers -s 404 -s '500 503' 'Foo: bar';

    is equivalent to

      more_set_headers -s '404 500 503' 'Foo: bar';

    The new header should be the one of the forms:

    1.  "Name: Value"

    2.  "Name: "

    3.  "Name"

    The last two effectively clear the value of the header "Name".

    Nginx variables are allowed in header values. For example:

       set $my_var "dog";
       more_set_headers "Server: $my_var";

    But variables won't work in header keys due to performance
    considerations.

    Multiple set/clear header directives are allowed in a single location,
    and they're executed sequentially.

    Directives inherited from an upper level scope (say, http block or
    server blocks) are executed before the directives in the location block.

    Behind the scene, use of this directive and its friend
    more_clear_headers will (lazily) register an ouput header filter that
    modifies "r->headers_out" the way you specify.

  more_clear_headers
    syntax: *more_clear_headers [-t <content-type list>]... [-s <status-code
    list>]... <new-header>...*

    default: *no*

    context: *http, server, location, if*

    Clears the specified output headers.

    In fact,

       more_clear_headers -s 404 -t 'text/plain' Foo Baz;

    is exactly equivalent to

       more_set_headers -s 404 -t 'text/plain' "Foo: " "Baz: ";

    or

       more_set_headers -s 404 -t 'text/plain' Foo Baz

    See more_set_headers for more details.

  more_set_input_headers
    syntax: *more_set_input_headers [-t <content-type list>]...
    <new-header>...*

    default: *no*

    context: *http, server, location, if*

    Very much like more_set_headers except that it operates on input headers
    (or request headers) and it only supports the "-t" option.

    Behind the scene, use of this directive and its friend
    more_clear_input_headers will (lazily) register a "rewrite phase"
    handler that modifies "r->headers_in" the way you specify. Note that it
    always run at the *end* of the "rewrite" so that it runs *after* the
    standard rewrite module and works in subrequests as well.

  more_clear_input_headers
    syntax: *more_clear_input_headers [-t <content-type list>]...
    <new-header>...*

    default: *no*

    context: *http, server, location, if*

    Clears the specified input headers.

    In fact,

       more_clear_input_headers -s 404 -t 'text/plain' Foo Baz;

    is exactly equivalent to

       more_set_input_headers -s 404 -t 'text/plain' "Foo: " "Baz: ";

    or

       more_set_input_headers -s 404 -t 'text/plain' Foo Baz

    See more_set_input_headers for more details.

Limitations
    *   Unlike the standard headers module, this module does not
        automatically take care of the constraint among the "Expires",
        "Cache-Control", and "Last-Modified" headers. You have to get them
        right yourself or use the headers module together with this module.

Installation
    Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (<http://nginx.net/>), for
    example, the version 0.8.29 (see nginx compatibility), and then build
    the source with this module:

        $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.29.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.29.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-0.8.29/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/headers-more-nginx-module

        $ make -j2
        $ make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    headers-more-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/headers-more-nginx-module/downloads>).

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   0.8.x (last tested version is 0.8.31)

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.44 (last tested version is 0.7.64)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.44 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.

Report Bugs
    Although a lot of effort has been put into testing and code tuning,
    there must be some serious bugs lurking somewhere in this module. So
    whenever you are bitten by any quirks, please don't hesitate to

    1.  send a bug report or even patches to <agentzh@gmail.com>,

    2.  or create a ticket on the issue tracking interface
        (<http://github.com/agentzh/headers-more-nginx-module/issues>)
        provided by GitHub.

    Available on github at agentzh/headers-more-nginx-module
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/headers-more-nginx-module>).

ChangeLog
  v0.07
    *   fixed the more_clear_headers directive for builtin headers like
        "Server" and "Last-Modified" by always inserting an empty header
        when absent. Thanks Sebastiaan Deckers for reporting it.

  v0.06
    *   now the input header handler runs at the *end* of the "rewrite
        phase" such that it works in subrequests by default.

  v0.05
    *   fixed variables in more_set_input_headers by registering the handler
        in the "access phase" instead of the "rewrite" phase.

Test Suite
    This module comes with a Perl-driven test suite. The test cases
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/headers-more-nginx-module/tree/master/test/t
    />) are declarative
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/headers-more-nginx-module/blob/master/test/t
    /sanity.t>) too. Thanks to the Test::Base
    (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Base>) module in the Perl world.

    To run it on your side:

        $ cd test
        $ PATH=/path/to/your/nginx-with-headers-more-module:$PATH prove -r t

    You need to terminate any Nginx processes before running the test suite
    if you have changed the Nginx server binary.

    At the moment, LWP::UserAgent
    (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?LWP::UserAgent>) is used by the test
    scaffold
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/headers-more-nginx-module/blob/master/test/l
    ib/Test/Nginx/LWP.pm>) for simplicity.

    Because a single nginx server (by default, "localhost:1984") is used
    across all the test scripts (".t" files), it's meaningless to run the
    test suite in parallel by specifying "-jN" when invoking the "prove"
    utility.

    Some parts of the test suite requires modules proxy, rewrite, and echo
    to be enabled as well when building Nginx.

TODO
    *   Support variables in new headers' keys.
